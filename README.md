### Python and GIT project
For Udacity course: Programming for Data Science with Python

### Description
This project analyze bikeshare data from three cities: Chicago, New York and Washington in USA using Python in an interactive way. Data used was provided by Motivate <https://www.motivateco.com/>.

### Data type and variables
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

      Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
      End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
      Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
      Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
      End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
      User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The **Chicago** and **New York City** files also have the following two columns:

      Gender
      Birth Year

### Output and Analysis

-  Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
-  Popular stations and trip
-  Trip duration
-  User info
